+ By default, django sqlite as its default DATABASE configuration

+ There exists a magic command >> inspectdb
+ Instead of writing django models from scratch, this command helps django to read our mysql schema and write 
  the python code for us.
cmd : >>python manage.py inspectdb > models.py

IMPORTANT CHECKS : Cleaning up the models.py
+ Move the models.py file generated inside our app
+ Inside the models.py, you will see managed = False in the class Meta of every model.
+ Keep managed = False: this tells django, "Do not try to change these tables via migrations, I am managing the
                                            schema via the schema.sql file"
+ Check primary keys : Ensure Django correctly identified userID, accountID, etc as pk

+ register the models in admin.py

MISTAKES COMMITED WHILE DOING THE PROJECT :

a.) project_name and base directory me differen urls.py honge -> 
<project_name> -> urls.py -> we add a path for the base/url.py -> path('',include('base.urls'))

b.) settings.py -> INSTALLED_APPS -> include the app -> 'base',

c.) global templates directory -> outside with the base and <project_name> directory hogi
    settings.py -> TEMPLATES -> 'DIRS' : [ BASE_DIR / 'templates' ] -> ye add karenge -> to let django know
    about our base directories

d.) admin.py -> me models register karne se pehle import karwana hoga -> import .models from <model_names>,,,

e.) app ki urls.py -> import . from views -> to use the views logic from views.py 

f.) ALWAYS REMEMBER -> to generate csrf_token from 'POST' methods
